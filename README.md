**BlockLock**

This plugin enables you to restrict players placing or breaking specific blocks.

THIS PLUGIN IS NOT AFFILIATED IN ANY WAY WITH THE PLUGIN 'BlockLocker' OR ANY SERVICES/COMPANIES WITH A SIMILAR NAME
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THESE, AND WANT THE NAME CHANGED I'LL DO SO ASAP

Since the plugin is in a rather early stage, I have following goals in mind:
- Enhancing plugin efficiency

I hope this resource helps you, or you have fun with it.
